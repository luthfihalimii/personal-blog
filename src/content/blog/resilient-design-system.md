Design systems are living organisms. They change with every component we evolve, yet they have to provide a stable language for dozens of teams building on top of them. Astro's island architecture lets us ship isolated UI pieces that hydrate independently, which keeps the entire system responsive without overwhelming the browser.

## Start with resilient primitives

The core of the system is a small set of primitivesâ€”buttons, typography scales, spacing tokens, and surface treatments. Each primitive is documented as MDX-like snippets embedded in Astro pages so that designers and engineers see the exact implementation they will reuse. By versioning these tokens we can roll out visual improvements without breaking downstream consumers.

## Illuminate with motion

Micro-interactions work when they reinforce meaning. I rely on requestAnimationFrame-driven timelines, which makes the motion buttery on high-refresh displays and accessible on low-powered devices. Pair that with prefers-reduced-motion media queries so that the experience remains inclusive.

## Ship audits alongside releases

Every major release includes automated visual regression tests. They run on CI using Playwright and a headless browser, comparing key pages across themes. It adds minutes to the pipeline, but it saves hours of manual QA while protecting that neon vibe.
