Astro focuses on shipping as little JavaScript as possible by default. React thrives when you isolate interactive areas into islands. Combining them means you can render the majority of the page at build time while progressively enhancing widgets that genuinely need client-side state.

### Lean into partial hydration

Bundle splitting happens per island, so tab navigations, comment feeds, or dashboards hydrate only when visible. This removes the guilt of bringing in a React component library since Astro will never ship it unless the user reaches the island.

### Cache the shell aggressively

Static output means you can cache the entire shell on a CDN. React components that fetch data at runtime can still opt into SSR or client-side fetching while the rest of the HTML stays immutable. The result is a first paint measured in milliseconds, not seconds.

### Use Astro components for layout

Astro components still shine for templating and data loading. I keep React islands scoped to stateful experiences, while Astro handles routing, meta tags, and content collections. It is a pragmatic split that keeps the project delightful to maintain.
